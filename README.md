I used to frequently use the spf13-vim toolkit, which offered a wide range of features.
However, the spf13-vim toolkit was quite heavy and had a slow startup time. 
This led me to the idea of optimizing and streamlining it, 
resulting in my own customized Vim configuration: vimrc-ex. 
The main highlight of this configuration is the incorporation of Vim's Timer functionality, 
which greatly enhances the loading speed.

# Install
```
cd vimrc_ye_cfg

./install.sh
```


# Requirements
To make all the plugins work, specifically [neocomplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim), you need [vim with lua](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim#requirements).

If you are working with C language, you need to install the ctags and cscope tools.

It is better to use vim8.x or later, although vim7.4 is also supported.
